Once upon a time, I was musician--but I found being poor didn't agree with me.  I moved on through a number of career changes before eventually finding my way back to school for a Computer Science degree.  I like puzzles and building things.  I have always been and am still more or less fixated on audio recording tech.  I own more microphones than any one person should outside of a studio.
